Hi , I'm Ali - " علي "

I just want to say one thing : 

In a job market filld with new graduates , self-taught and  experinced layedoff developers , does it matter what I'm learing ? No ,it's already bad , that's why I'm gonna start learning Ruby on Rails first then contuine my learning journy with JS .

I'm also a human with emotions , so I do have hobbys and one of them is game development , so , don't be be suprised if you see me talking about that . I also love CATS
