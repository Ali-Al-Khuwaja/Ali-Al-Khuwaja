Hi, I'm Ali - " علي "

I just want to say one thing : 

In a job market filld with new graduates, self-taught and  experinced layedoff developers, does it matter what I'm learning ? No, it's already bad, that's why I'm gonna start learning Ruby on Rails first then continue my learning journey with JS .





I'm also a human with emotions, so I do have hobbys and one of them is game development, so, don't be surprised if you see me talking about it. I also love CATS
